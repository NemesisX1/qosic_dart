## Usage üî®



### Make a payment

A simple example of how to compute a USSD payment with QOSIC

```dart

final qosic = QosicDart(
  moovKey: 'XXXXXXXXXx',
  mtnKey: 'XXXXXXXXXX',
  username: 'XXXXXXXXXX',
  password: 'XXXXXXXXX',
);

final transactionRef = await qosic.pay(
    network: QosicNetwork.mtn,
    phoneNumber: 'XXXXXXXX', /// precedeed by the country code. ex: 229XXXXXXXX
    amount: '1',
  );

Timer.periodic(
    const Duration(
      seconds: 10, /// feel free to give your own second to wait
                   /// but I will advice you between 7 and 10 secs
    ),
    (timer) async {
      final status = await qosic.getPaymentStatus(
        transactionReference: transactionRef!,
        network: QosicNetwork.mtn,
        country: QosicCountry.benin,
      );

      if (status == QosicStatus.successfull || status == QosicStatus.failed) {
        timer.cancel();
        if (status == QosicStatus.successfull) {
          log("Success for payment");
        } else {
          log("Payment failed");
        }
      }
    },
);

```

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Qosic Dart comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit tests:

```sh
dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
dart test --coverage=coverage
dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```
